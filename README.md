# Santander-Customer-satisfaction-prediction
Customer satisfaction prediction using deep learning

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

Santander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.

Keras with tensorflow backend has been used for this data after data cleaning steps.
